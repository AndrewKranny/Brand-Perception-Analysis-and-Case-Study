# Brand Perception Case Study
 
### Problem Breifing
TelCo Inc., a telecommunications company, has noticed that the companyâ€™s customer satisfaction (CSAT)
scores are low and contact volume is high.
The client is concerned about how the poor experience is impacting their brand perception. The client
thinks there are some opportunities to improve the end-to-end customer experience, but they are not sure
what their customers pain points are.
They have asked you to analyze their current state and identify if there is anything driving these issues
and then present the story behind the numbers at an executive meeting.
